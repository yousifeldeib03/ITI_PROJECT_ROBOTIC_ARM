## Features  

- **Multi-Joint Control**: Independent control of 3 arm joints plus gripper operation  
- **Dual Control Modes**:  
  - 180° precision positioning (MG90S servo)  
  - Continuous rotation control (MG995 servo)  
  - Stepper motor precision movement (28BYJ-48)  
- **Intuitive Interface**: 4×4 keypad for controlling each motor with dedicated CW/CCW buttons  
- **Real-Time Feedback**: LCD (16×2) displays current motor status and rotation direction  
- **Precise Actuation**: ULN2003 motor drivers for reliable stepper motor control  
- **Modular Design**: Well-structured firmware architecture for maintainability and expansion

## Hardware Components  

- **Microcontroller**: ATmega32  
- **Servo Motors**:  
  - MG90S Micro Servo (180° rotation)  
  - MG995 Servo Motor (360° continuous rotation)  
- **Stepper Motors**: 2× 28BYJ-48 with ULN2003 drivers  
- **User Interface**: 16×2 LCD, 4×4 Keypad  
- **Power**: Separate regulated power supplies for MCU and motors

## Control Scheme  

The 4×4 keypad provides dedicated control for each motor:  

- Two switches per motor for clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation  
- Real-time LCD display shows which motor is active and its rotation direction  
- Intuitive layout for precise manipulation of the robotic arm  

---

## Software Architecture  

The firmware is organized into layered architecture:  

- **LIB**: Bit-math operations and standard data types  
- **MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer)**: Direct hardware drivers (DIO, Timer, LCD, Keypad)  
- **HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)**: Device drivers (Servo, Stepper)  
- **Application Layer**: Main control logic and user interface management

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  

- **Compiler**: AVR-GCC  
- **Programmer**: USBasp, AVRISP, or compatible  
- **Simulation (optional)**: Proteus, SimulIDE
